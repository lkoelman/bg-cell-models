This is the readme for a NEURON implementation of a fast-spiking
cortical interneuron model, which was implemented by N.T. Carnevale
and V. Yamini.  Questions about this implementation may be addressed
to ted dot carnevale at yale dot edu

The conceptual model and the original, authoritative XPP
implementation were developed by Golomb et al. (2007) and described in

  Golomb D, Donner K, Shacham L, Shlosberg D, Amitai Y, Hansel D (2007).
  Mechanisms of Firing Patterns in Fast-Spiking Cortical Interneurons. 
  PLoS Comput Biol 3:e156.

The XPP implementation's source code is available from ModelDB via
accession number 97747, and may be retrieved from this URL:

  http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=97747


Usage:

Compile the mod files with mknrndll or nrnivmodl.

Load the model into NEURON by typing
  nrngui init_fig2c.hoc
or double clicking on
  init_fig2c.hoc

Run the model by clicking on Init & Run in the RunControl panel.  This
will reproduce the first 1000 ms of Fig. 2C from Golomb et al. (2007).
The fidelity of the reproduction is demonstrated by a graph that
overlays this simulation's membrane potential (red trace) on top of a
black & white gif that was captured from Fig. 2C.

Implementation notes:

Golomb et al. specified all conductances and currents in density
units, which is quite convenient for translation to a NEURON
implementation.  However, NEURON's IClamp is a direct counterpart to a
microelectrode attached to a current clamp, and as such it delivers a
current that is specified in absolute units, i.e. nanoamps.  To
replicate the published model with NEURON, the IClamp's amp parameter
must be set to a value that produces the same membrane current density
as the stimulus current described in the paper.

This NEURON implementation uses a single compartment with surface area
100 um2, so an injected current of 1 nA produces a current density of
1 mA/cm2.  Figure 2C requires a stimulus current of 3.35 uA/cm2, which
is equivalent to an IClamp with amp = 3.35/1000 = 0.00335 nA.

20130415 NTC introduced tiny first order delay in nas's m so that simulations 
with fixed dt > 0.02 ms would be stable.  With taum = 0.001 ms, fixed dt 
simulations show slight differences in spike timing compared to the original 
results, but adaptive integration produces results nearly identical to the 
original published figure.  See nas.mod for details.
