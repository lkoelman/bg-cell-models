This is the readme.txt for the model associated with the paper:

Akemann W, Knopfel T. Interaction of Kv3 potassium channels and
resurgent sodium current influences the rate of spontaneous firing of
Purkinje neurons. J Neurosci. 2006 Apr 26;26(17):4602-12.

These files were supplied by Akemann and Knopfel.

To use: simply autolaunch from ModelDB or 

1) download and extract the archive (zip file). 
2) Compile the mod files with the appropriate method (unix - run
nrnivmodl in the directory, mswin - run mknrndll in the directory
expanded from the archive, mac - drag the folder expanded from the
archive to the mknrndll icon in the Neuron folder)
3) run the model (in unix - nrngui mosinit.hoc, mswin - double click
on the mosinit.hoc file, mac - drag the mosinit.hoc file to the nrngui
icon in the Neuron folder)

6/8/2007 version updated: a short demonstration run has been added.
